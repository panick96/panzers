{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your software}
This was a Unity Project completed by Drew Sant, Spencer Warner, Nick Velasquez, Nathan Cook, and Misael Payan. This is just a fun little demo based off of the tanks flash game from the early 2000's.
**USE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARROW KEYS TO MOVE, UP AND DOWN TO ADJUST TURRET, AND SPACEBAR TO SHOOT**

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
The purpose of this project was to test our communication efforts, teamwork, coding, and environment set-up skills. The latter was tested a lot. We wanted to embrace our creativity and have fun at the same time.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
